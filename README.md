## Our actual project: Netflix TV Show Binge
With the Coronavirus pandemic forcing everyone into their homes in isolation, many people have found a ton of time on their hands. Having so much extra time, many people have turned to Netflix to help pass the time by binge watching TV shows on Netflix. TV shows, however, can be a long investment of time and if it's not a good show, it could be a lot of wasted time. Often times, when viewers want to pick a new show, they will want to check out user ratings to determine the quality and the binge time to gauge how long (or how short) they can enjoy the show before picking. Unfortunately, Netflix does not provide times for how long it would take to binge watch a show or really user ratings. As a result, we propose making an application that combines a Netflix API and the TMDB API. The Netflix API will obviously be pulling TV shows available on Netflix. Meanwhile, the TMDB API will pull average user ratings of each Netflix available TV show and will provide us with the run time for the show. Our application will then provide both TV shows, average show ratings, and run times for each show.

## Project Idea: Downtime

**Name is subject to change.**  
Saturdays are typically for the boys, but sometimes, you find yourself on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with nothing to do. Downtime is the perfect solution to your troubles. Downtime’s main goal is to give you **something** to do when you have **nothing** to do but want to do **something**. Given certain preferences like times and a budget, the application will be able to generate a dense schedule filled with many activities, ranging from nearby Eventbrite events to hidden-gem restaurants from Yelp. The application plans to support extra functionality in the form of consumer spending tracking, making use of services like Mint to track transaction activity. For example, let’s say you want the application to resolve this issue of yours: “I am free this Saturday from 12pm to 6pm. With a budget of $100, what are things I could do within walking distance?” The application will tailor a schedule of events and restaurants that are within a mile radius and won’t cost you an arm and a leg. The only other solution to having a free schedule is having friends...

## Backup Idea: Retail Arbitrage

**Name is subject to change.**  
This idea is to build a software designed to almost act like a price checker. If a consumer wants to purchase a given product online, the software is designed to compare the price of an item across several different online retail platforms. The app can function in two ways: it can either be an informational tool for the users, or we can function as a vendor. In the former case, we would give users an overview of retail markets and compare their prices, ultimately giving our customers a recommendation as to what is the best price on the market. In the latter case, we would offer our customers our own prices and ultimately sell the products to them.
