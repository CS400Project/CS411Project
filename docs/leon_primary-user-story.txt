Primary User Story - Restaurant Suggestion
As a user, I would like to be able to get restaurant recommendations for places that are nearby to me that I can go to when I have free time and I am hungry. Before I can use the software to look for restaurants, however, I must be logged in with my Google account and have my calendar connected to the software---please refer to the User Calendar Integration story for more details. After I (the user) have logged in and added times for availability, I should also enter in an address/location for my current location. The web application should provide a list of suggestions for nearby restaurants that are open within the given time frame I have provided. These restaurant suggestions should be taken from Yelp reviews. The suggestions provided should be ordered based on distance to the user entered location. The closer restaurants should be top suggestions and restaurants that are farther away should be further down the list.
