Primary User Story - User Calendar Integration
As a logged-in user, I would like to have the generated schedule integrate into my personal schedule, which I have on Google Calendar. Opening the app, I would like to see on the main menu (saved schedules, generate schedules function, etc.) a feature to integrate my generated schedule into my Google Calendar account. If I haven’t signed into the app before, I would sign into my Google account which would give the app permission to mess with my account’s calendar schedule. I would like to be able to select my generated schedule (one of possible many) and see visual confirmation in-app that my Calendar schedule has been modified. Opening my Google Calendar app, I should see my daily schedule with newly-added Calendar events, each representing an Eventbrite event or recommended Yelp restaurant. In the case where things don’t work, I would like visual confirmation, like an error message, that a function has failed.
