The user will first create an account with google account and after the account is created, the app will lead him through a series of set up on his activities preferences, event platforms preferences, and he will also sync his google calendar to the app. After the set up, he will be directed to the home page. In the home page, he will be able to scroll through all the new recommended events nearby, which are suggested based on the userâ€™s google calendar, with its time, location, price, phone numbers, link, and possibly other event info. For each event, the user can click interested, or not interested. Interested events will go to the interested tab and uninterested events will go to the uninterested tab. The events in both the interest and uninterested tabs will be automatically removed after the event time has passed. If the user decides to go to an event, simply tab the confirm button of the event in the interested tab and that event will be recorded in the user event history.
