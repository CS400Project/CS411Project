Primary User Story - Eventbrite
As a user, I would first create an account with google account (please refer to Andres' user story about User Calendar Integration) and after the account is created, the app will lead me through a series of set up on my activities preferences, event platforms preferences, and I will also sync my google calendar to the app. After the set up, I will be directed to the home page and in the home page, I will be able to scroll through all the new recommended events nearby, which are suggested based on my google calendar, with its time, location, price, phone numbers, link, and possibly other event info. For each event, I can click interested, or not interested. Interested events will go to the interested tab and uninterested events will go to the uninterested tab. The events in both the interest and uninterested tabs will be automatically removed after the event time has passed. If I decide to go to an event, I can simply tab the confirm button of the event in the interested tab and that event will be recorded in my event history, so I can look back in the future if I wanted to.
