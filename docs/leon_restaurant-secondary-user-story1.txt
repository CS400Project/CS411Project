Secondary User Story - Filtering Restaurants
This secondary user story is an extension of the Restaurant Suggestion primary user story. As a user, I would like to filter restaurant suggestions by cuisine, price, star-rating, and distance so I can pick a good restaurant based on my taste, distance, and budget. I would also like to look at the menus and pictures of the restaurant as well as the food served in addition to reading reviews. Each restaurant suggestion should also have an “x” button in the top right hand corner so I can manually filter and remove restaurants I do not want to go to.
