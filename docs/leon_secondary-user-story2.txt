Secondary User Story - Selecting a Restaurant
As a user, I would like the software to put a time slot I select in my calendar to eat at the restaurant I have chosen or notify me if the restaurant is closed during the time slot I selected. Once I have picked out a restaurant I want to go to, there should be a green button to the right of the restaurant name that says “Go!”. If I (the user) click “Go!” then there should be a small pop-up that allows me choose from when to when I would like to go to the restaurant. If a restaurant is closed, the software should have a popup appear that tells me to choose another time when the restaurant is open or choose another restaurant. If I have selected a valid time when the restaurant is open, then the web application should set aside a time slot in my calendar that I have selected. Another popup should show up that says that the web application does not guarantee me a seat at the selected restaurant at the selected time since the app does not create reservations. The popup should also provide me with the restaurant’s phone number  and tell me to call ahead of time to either set up a reservation and/or determine how long the wait is for a table if the restaurant does not take reservations.
