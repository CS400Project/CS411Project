<p><strong>Name is subject to change.</strong><br>
Saturdays are typically for the boys, but sometimes, you find yourself on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with nothing to do. Downtime is the perfect solution to your troubles. Downtime’s main goal is to give you <strong>something</strong> to do when you have <strong>nothing</strong> to do but want to do <strong>something</strong>. Given certain preferences like times and a budget, the application will be able to generate a dense schedule filled with many activities, ranging from nearby Eventbrite events to hidden-gem restaurants from Yelp. The application plans to support extra functionality in the form of consumer spending tracking, making use of services like Mint to track transaction activity. For example, let’s say you want the application to resolve this issue of yours: “I am free this Saturday from 12pm to 6pm. With a budget of $100, what are things I could do within walking distance?” The application will tailor a schedule of events and restaurants that are within a mile radius and won’t cost you an arm and a leg. The only other solution to having a free schedule is having friends...</p>
<h2 id="backup-idea-retail-arbitrage">Backup Idea: Retail Arbitrage</h2>
<p><strong>Name is subject to change.</strong><br>
This idea is to build a software designed to almost act like a price checker. If a consumer wants to purchase a given product online, the software is designed to compare the price of an item across several different online retail platforms. The app can function in two ways: it can either be an informational tool for the users, or we can function as a vendor. In the former case, we would give users an overview of retail markets and compare their prices, ultimately giving our customers a recommendation as to what is the best price on the market. In the latter case, we would offer our customers our own prices and ultimately sell the products to them.</p>
